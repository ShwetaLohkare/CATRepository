 # Description: This exercise plays around with fitting "gizmos"
 #  into a bag that can only fit a certain number of "gizmos"
 #  This exercise should give you more experience with 
 #  If-statements and While-loops

 Feature: It Just Fits
 
Background: 
Given I assign 60 to variable "gizmos"

 @instructions @1
 Scenario: Setting up Feature File
 Given I "update the Feature File Header with my name and the current date"
 And I "have a bag that can fit 50 “gizmos” inside of it."

 When I "set the variable “gizmos” to a number greater than 50 in the Background"
 And I "run the test and see that fails"

 Then I "see on line 48 an If statement that checks that $gizmos is less than or equal to 50. If you changed what $gizmos was equal to, we could make it fit."

 @instructions @2
 Scenario: If I Have More Options
 Given I "have a second bag that can fit 70 gizmos, but we want to use the smaller bag if we can"
 When I "an ElsIf statement that follows the If statement that checks if Gizmos is less than 70"
 And I "echo 'This will fit in the big bag' if $gizmos is greater than 50 but less than or equal to 70"
 Then I "update $gizmos so that it is greater than 50 but less than 70" 
 And I "run the test"
 And I "see that the test passes"

 @instructions @3
 Scenario: While Away the Time
 Given I "have decided I do not want to use my big bag but I still want to bring as many gizmos as possible"
 When I "replace the entire if-statement with a while loop"
 and I "have the while-loop reduce $gizmos by 1 each time it loops until we have 50 or fewer Gizmos"
 And I "run the test"
 And I "see that the test passes"

 @instructions @4
 Scenario: A Gizmo Saved is a Gizmo Earned
 Given I "don't want to waste time removing a lot of gizmos"
 When I "wrap an if-statement around the while statement so that the while-loop only runs if $gizmos is set to a number less than or equal to 75"
 And I "add an Else statement that says 'That's too many gizmos!'"
 Then I "run the test"
 And I "see that the test passes if $gizmos is set to 75 or fewers Gizmos or fails otherwise"

@itJustFit
  Scenario: It Just Fits
   If I verify number $gizmos is less than or equal to 50
  	Then I echo "It fits!"
   Else I echo "Too many gizmos!"
   EndIf

# While I verify number $gizmos is greater than or equal to 50
# 	Then I decrease variable "gizmos" by 1
#   And I echo "More than 50 gizmos"
# EndWhile


While I verify number $gizmos is less than or equal to 75

	If I verify number $gizmos is less than 70
    	Then I echo "Keep adding gizmos"
        
		Elsif I verify number $gizmos is greater than 50
    		And I verify number $gizmos is less than or equal to 70
     	  	Then I echo "This will fit in the big bag"
        
		Else I echo "Too many gizmos !!!"
	Endif
And I increase variable "gizmos" by 1
EndWhile

And I echo "Cannot add more gizmos"
